Web Search Engines Homeworks

Homework 0
You goal here is to implement a simple HTTP server that takes a user query at path /search through CGI argument query, and returns the same query back to the user.

Homework 1
In this homework assignment, you will be implementing an infrastructure for the design and evaluation of core ranking methods. We will provide you with skeleton code which you will then augment with additional functionality.

As we mentioned in class, a search engine can be broken down into several components. In this assignment, you will be modifying our code for the front end, the ranker, and the evaluator. We will provide a very simple index which you will be modifying in Homework 2.

Homework 2
In this homework assignment, you will implement components related to document processing and indexing, as well as refactor your ranking components developed in Homework 1 to take advantage of improved indexing components. We will provide you with the skeleton code that you will augment with the desired functionalities.

Homework 3
In this homework assignment, you have two main tasks:
1) implementing components for computing intrinsic document qualities such as PageRank and NumViews;
2) implementing and analying pseudo-relevance feedback for query expansion.

For the first task, we will provide you with the skeleton code that you will augment with the desired functionalities. For the second task, we will not be providing skeleton code and you will need to design the class based on what we have.
